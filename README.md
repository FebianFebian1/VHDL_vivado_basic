# VHDL basic with vivado and its implementation

This is a repository encompasses basic coding in VHDL using Vivado from AMD. It provides a step-by-step guide in making your first project to implementiation on FPGA. 

In this instance, the software and hardware specifications are as follows:
1. **Software version**: Vivado 2020.2 
2. **FPGA board used**: Xilinx Nexys Video
3. **Product family**: Artix-7 FPGA
4. **FPGA Part**: XC7A200T-1SBG484C
5. **Source**: Digilent

It is expected that you have installed the vivado software and have an FPGA to be play around with. **If you download a different version of Vivado, a different interface might occurs. However, functionality wise it should remains the same.**
