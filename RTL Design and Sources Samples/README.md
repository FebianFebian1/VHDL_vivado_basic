# Design Sources and Constraints

In this section we will be looking at some source examples on how to implement basic logic gates, flip flops and clock using VHDL language. We will also look at how to assign pin to the FPGA using constraints file (.xdc file).

### 1. Design Sources

The **"design sources"** folder contains the VHDL code used in the project to be synthesis and impelemented to the FPGA board.
